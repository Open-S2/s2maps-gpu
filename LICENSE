s2maps-gpu must be used according to the S2 Maps Terms of Service. This license
allows developers with a current active S2 Maps account to use and modify the
S2 Maps Web SDK. Developers may modify the S2 Maps Web SDK code so long as the
modifications do not change or interfere with marked portions of the code related
to billing, accounting, and anonymized data collection. The S2 Maps Web SDK
only sends anonymized usage data, which S2 Maps uses for fixing bugs and errors,
accounting, and generating aggregated anonymized statistics. This license terminates
automatically if a user no longer has an active S2 Maps account.
