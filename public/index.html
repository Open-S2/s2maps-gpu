    <meta name="description" content="S2 Maps is an early stage startup designed
    to help break from what I believe is a severely outdated norm in cartography:
    flat projections. Unlike the current commonly used projections, the S2
    projection represents all data on a three-dimensional sphere, making it
    possible to store and present a planets geographic database with no seems,
    singularities, or discontinuities. Even though the Earth (and Mars) is not
    quite a sphere either, it is possible to properly approximate the entire
    Earthâ€™s surface with a maximum distortion of ~0.56%. This is achieved by
    storing points as unit vectors instead of latitude/longitude pairs. This
    decision also allows S2 to respect both geocentric and geodetic coordinate
    systems while increasing the robustness by, for example, avoiding potential
    topological errors. The S2 projection comes at no higher cost
    in efficiency or data storage than say the Mercator projection, due to how
    the data is encoded. S2 Maps stores the unit vector onto a quad-tree schemed
    cube map with a non-linear transformation to reduce distortion.">

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
